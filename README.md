# Random-AutoClick
A simple AutoClick, that click with a random generated delay. This can bypass some Anti-Autoclick method.

There is a profile functionality that can be used to save several settings.

You can ajust the delay of the autoclick and it will vary between your delay value and your value + 20ms, the variation can be ajusted if you turn on the advanced mode.

Once you've clicked on Activate, you will need to press the Verr.maj button to activate the autoclick and press it again to desactivate it.

Here is the .exe file if you just want to use it :
